You put the washing machine and set my timer to remind you.  Then same for the dryer.

But the washer is 38 min and dryer is 50 min!

Wouldn't it be nice to have an app dedicated to this that knows how many loads you put as well?

For now its just an idea.  Any developers interested please contact me!
Thank you!

## MockUp ##
(Ignore the iApp-A-Day as this idea was originally for that, but it doesnt look like it'll happen)

## How it would work ##
the user would:

1: start the app

2: tap settings and set there machines default cycle times

3: choose notifications

4: tap "loads" button to set the # of loads put

5: tap the red button to start/stop the timer.  Maybe double tap to reset it?

6: when the user exits the app it would run in the background

7: when a cycle is complete the user would get a notification similar
to the missed text/voicemail/call messge stating that the washer or
dryer cycle is complete.

8: user would tap ok, cycle is reset, and the user would go pull there
laundry :]
